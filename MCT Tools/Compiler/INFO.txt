- clear, powerful, easy-to-use API
- compilation from program arguments
- JSON validation
- code checking, incl. mod classes
- mulitple language support (modular, see bottom of file)
- MSBuild support
- build from managed DLL


    The compiler consists of the following parts:
       (- Extractor (Only when building from a .dll))
        - Validator (validate json, etc)
       (- Builder   (build code to .dll - MSBuild or CodeDom))
                    (skipped when building from a .dll, obviously)
        - Checker   (checks assembly for ModBase and other stuff)
        - Writer    (write to tapi/tapimod file)

    Each part gives the result to the next part, together with the CompilerOptions.

    - assembly: Input -> Extractor  -> Validator -> ------- -> Checker -> Writer -> Output
    - source:         -> FileLoader ->           -> Builder ->

    Input:  mod folder name or assembly path
    Output: wether it succeeded or not, output file (if succeeded), errors (if failed)

    If the compilation fails at one part of the chain, the next one(s) aren't executed,
    and the CompilerOutput is returned immedately.

supported languages:
  installed by default:
    C#
    VB
    JScript.NET

  separately:
    ClojureCLR
    F#

  C++/CLI will only be supported through MSBuild or DLL building, because CL is shipped with Visual Studio, not .NET.


This might be considered a hack.

BTW, this everything in here is done by some 15-year-old...
